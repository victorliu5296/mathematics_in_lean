Naming conventions:

Theorems about specific functions or operations often start with the function or operation name.
Inequality theorems include parts like _le_ for "less than or equal to" and _lt_ for "less than."
Additional conditions or specific forms of the theorem are added as suffixes (usually with "of" prefixing each condition).

Example Breakdown: add_lt_add_of_le_of_lt
add: This theorem is about addition.
lt_add: It involves a less than (<) relation in the addition context.
of_le_of_lt: This indicates that the theorem uses both a "less than or equal to" (â‰¤) and a "less than" (<) condition.
